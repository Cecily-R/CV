## Cecily Rowland

I am an enthusiastic junior full-stack developer looking to embark on a career in tech, with a particular interest in Tech For Good.

After graduating from the University of Kent with a 1st Class Honours in History of Art, I worked for three years in Public Relations, before moving to the Tate Modern as a Visitors Experience Assistant. While I greatly valued my time in Public Relations and at the Tate Modern, and learned so much, I was yet to find the career that made me excited to go to work in the morning. 

I first discovered the world of tech while I was working in PR, through a femtech company that I represented. The more I learn about the industry, the more excited I become about its capacity to change how we live for the better. I enrolled at Makers Academy in November 2022 as I was keen for a new challenge in a different field, where I could also put my varied and extensive skillset to good use.

## Skills

### Quick Learner

My capability to think on my feet and use my initiative was frequently tested during my time in PR. From trying my hand at unknown social media software to managing junior staff members, my adaptability to new challenges has helped me quickly get to grips with complex systems and multiple requirements at once.

### Curious & Inquisitive 

My curiosity and inquisitiveness are two of the key attributes that put me on the path to working as a software developer. I have always been fascinated by the inner workings of computers, and the relationship between front-end and back-end software.

### Creativity 

From working in a corporate environment, or directly with the public, to learning how to code, my ability to approach problems creatively and pragmatically has enabled me to succinctly find solutions in difficult situations.

### Eye for detail 

Being responsible for both the image and reputation of clients in PR has resulted in my developing a keen attention to detail. This awareness has already informed how I write and refactor my code.  

### Team player

I have always considered myself a people person, and whether working with fifty colleagues at the Tate Modern on a daily basis, or working within a tight-knit group of seven in PR agencies, I have been able to further develop these innate communication skills.

### Kind 

Empathy is something I see as integral for a positive and supportive workforce. Whether managing junior members of the team or working with members of the public during moments of heightened distress, my ability to actively listen and understand the perspectives of others has proven invaluable in diffusing negative situations.

### Resilient & determined

I seek out constructive feedback and view it in a positive light. I always want to learn and improve and I view being open to suggestions as the best way to achieve this.
